## Wisent v1.0.0 - Recent changes (1 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r0:
	<Initial release based on the outdated Bison-2.4.4 (which was last updated in Cataclysm) >
	
	Fixed an issue that caused spell procs to spam the client with LUA errors while they were active
	Fixed broken backdrop textures for anchors that are displayed when the addon is unlocked
	
	Unlocked group frames are now always shown when enabled (to avoid them bugging out after reloadUI/relog)
	The "debug" setting is now saved properly across sessions and restored at startup, as it should always have been
