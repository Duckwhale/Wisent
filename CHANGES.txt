## Wisent v1.0.0 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r3:
	Updated ProcsBar for Legion with the newest spell IDs. This includes Monk and Demon Hunters, which were still missing. The list is probably not quite complete - let me know if I forgot to include something!
	
	Note: Existing settings for the ProcsBar may be reset if you changed them from the defaults. This is a side effect of the update and will only happen once
	

r2:
	Reworked localisation system and integrated it with the CurseForge packager
	Fixed horrible grammar in the default (English) translation and removed the other, now-obsolete locales (will require a re-translation)


r1:
	Reworked ComboBar to track Legion "combo points" (and spells/buffs that fulfill a similar role) for all classes
