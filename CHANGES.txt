## Wisent v1.0.0 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r2:
	Reworked localisation system and integrated it with the CurseForge packager
	Fixed grammar in the default (English) translation and removed the other, now-obsolete locales (will need new translations)


r1:
	Reworked ComboBar to track Legion "combo points" (and spells/buffs that fulfill a similar role) for all classes

	
r0:
	This is the initial release based on the outdated Bison-2.4.4 (which was last updated in Cataclysm) 
	
	Fixed an issue that caused spell procs to spam the client with LUA errors while they were active
	Fixed broken backdrop textures for anchors that are displayed when the addon is unlocked
	
	Unlocked group frames are now always shown when enabled (to avoid them bugging out after reloadUI/relog)
	The "debug" setting is now saved properly across sessions and restored at startup, as it should always have been
